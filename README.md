# Title Goes Here

This an interpreter for an unnamed stack-based scripting language.

The interpreter is implemented in Python and very much incomplete. The whole project is a personal experiment. 

See the bottom of `stackscript/runtime.py` for example of usage. Or just run `python -m stackscript.runtime` from the repository root to see some examples.

Also included is a slightly modified version of PLY which I am using as the lexer. 
I plan to replace it with a simple regex-based lexer, as I'm not really doing anything fancy.

At the end of this readme is an operator reference.

## Usage
Python 3.8+ required.

At the command prompt, run `python interpreter.py`.

Or run `python interpreter.py --help` for command line options.

## TODO
- A proper name
- Actually load script files or run as a REPL.
- Prelude mechanism, so that a standard library of builtin names can be loaded into the global scope.
- A dictionary or mapping type.

## About the Language

I wanted to see how far I could get with designing a stack-based scripting language. As my guide my aim to make the language as expressive and easy to use as I can within the constraint of the language being stack-based in its syntax.

Also, this being my first step into the world of programming language design, I wanted something easy to start with and stack based languages are really easy to parse.

Other inspirations for this language come from Python, Lua, and a bit of Scheme/LISP.

The implementation is still incomplete, I've only started working on it this past week. But I've made a lot of progress so far and I really like the direction it's going.

Anyways, more about the language itself (still yet to be named):

Naturally since it is stack-based all expressions are RPN.

    >>> 3 2 * 4 +
    10

You can assign values to identifiers using the assignment operator `:`.

    [1 2 3 'a' 'b' 'c']: mylist

Right now the available data types are booleans, integers, floats, strings, lists, and blocks. The block type is really important so I will get back to that later.

In the future I'd like to have immutable and mutable flavours of lists.

I also want to add a Lua-inspired "table" mapping type that also supports Lua-style metatables. I think this will add a lot of *oomph* to the language without needing to add the weight of a fully-fledged object system.

Like Lua I plan to have a small closed set of types. I think you can do a lot with just lists, tables, and primitives.

Now, back to the "block" type. Blocks are immutable containers that contain unexecuted code. This part of the language is inspired by GolfScript.

Blocks can be invoked using the "invoke" operator `!`. This operator pops two values off of the stack, a block and a single argument value.

    >>> 4 { 1+ }!  // adds 1 to the argument
    5

If you assign a block to an identifier, you can use them like functions.

    {.*}: sqr;  // duplicates the argument, then multiplies 
                // semicolon just clears the stack, helpful for avoiding accidents
    4 sqr!

Blocks are just values, so you can put them in lists, pass them when invoking another block, etc.

When the `!` operator is used the block operand is executed in a new "scope" where the argument is the only value on the stack.

This done is for programmer sanity. However, for efficiency, no new stack needs to be created. Instead, a "stack protection" pointer can be used that raises an error if the interpreter tries to pop values beyond it (pretending that the stack is empty). When the block is done executing this pointer can then be cleared.

Identifiers are local to their scope though, so the interpreter still needs to allocate a data structure for that.

Another example, calculating the factorial.

```
{
    :n; // assign the argument to the name "n"
    // "if" will pop 3 items from the stack, like a ternary operator
    n 0 <=
    1
    { n 1- factorial! n * } if
}: factorial;

// alternatively
{
    . 0 > {. 1- factorial! *} {;1} if
}: factorial;

5 factorial!
```

When functions require multiple arguments an argument list can be passed.

    [1 2 'a'] foo!

In addition to the evaluate operator `!`, there are two other operators that act on blocks: map `/` and fold `%`.

Both take two operands, a block and a list.

The map operator `/` invokes a block on every element of a list and produces a new list from the results.

    >>> [2 3 4 5] {.*}/
    [4 9 16 25]

Unlike `!` or `/`, the fold operator `%` does not execute the block in a new scope. Instead, for each item in the list operand, `%` will push the item onto the stack and then evaluate the block directly in the current scope.

    >>> 0 [2 3 1 5] {+}%  // sum a list of values
    11

Of course you can wrap the `%` expression in a block for safety.

```
// a sum "function"
{
    :seq; // assign the sole argument to the name "seq"
    0 seq {+}%
}: sum;

[2 3 1 5] sum!
```

Last thing, about handling argument lists. There's an indexing operator `$` that replaces a list and an integer with the n-th item in the list.

    >>> ['a' 'b' 'c'] 1$
    'a'

This combined with the stack manipulation operators `.` (duplicate) and `,` (drop) allow you to assign positional arguments to local identifiers in a way that looks really nice.

```
{
    .$1: first,
    .$2: second,
    .$3: third;  // you could put these on one line if you want

    first second + third *
}: add_then_mult;

[3 4 5] add_then_mult!
```

I imagine named arguments could be accomodated Lua-style by passing a single table as the argument.
